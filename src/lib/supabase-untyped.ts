/**
 * Typed wrapper for Supabase tables not yet in the generated schema.
 * Eliminates `as any` casts at call sites while maintaining type safety.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const { data } = await untypedFrom<MyType>("my_table").select("*").eq("id", id);
 *   //              data is MyType[] from the generic, not never[]
 *
 * Strategy:
 *   The Supabase generated types narrow `from()` to known table names. Any
 *   other string falls back to the `audit_logs` row shape, which causes TS2339
 *   floods on every property access. Casting `supabase` itself to a
 *   permissive `SupabaseClient<any>` restores the unrestricted builder so
 *   the row-shape generic `T` flows through `select()`, `insert()`, and
 *   `update()`.
 *
 * Migration note, post-colapso 2026-05-24:
 *   The 5 tables previously listed in UntypedTable now exist in the database
 *   through PRs #315 and #317. Once `supabase gen types typescript` is rerun
 *   and types.ts is updated, the remaining `untypedFrom("...")` call sites in
 *   src/ should migrate to `supabase.from("...")` for full type safety. This
 *   file remains a safety net for future tables that are not in the generated
 *   schema yet.
 *
 *   CI guard: `.github/workflows/lint-untyped-from.yml` fails the build if any
 *   `untypedFrom("X")` call references a table not present in types.ts. That
 *   is the exact condition that caused silent failures on 2026-05-24.
